# influence_poster

------------

I've grown up with a lot of influences, mostly related to reading.
We redid our house in 2015 and when doing so, I decided not to use my
commercial poster collection and instead create a new poster, entirely
charting my influences via a "collage" of sorts. My sister offered the
chance to do this because she suggested that we could use a glass door
for the wardrobe of my room.

I made the poster using Gimp, and I printed it out to scale at a print shop,
quite an expensive ordeal.

I wanted to share this somewhere so I could keep track of the changes.
However, the master file is so large that I'm keeping it in Dropbox,
the original location.
