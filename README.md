# Influence Poster

------------

I've grown up with a lot of influences, mostly related to reading.
We redid our house in 2015 and when doing so, I decided not to use my
commercial poster collection and instead create a new poster, entirely
charting my influences via a "collage" of sorts. My sister offered the
chance to do this because she suggested that we could use a glass door
for the wardrobe of my room.

I made the poster using Gimp, and I printed it out to scale at a print shop,
quite an expensive ordeal.

I wanted to share this somewhere so I could keep track of the changes.
However, the master file is so large that I'm keeping it in Dropbox,
the original location.

## An Explanation

------------------

The idea was to visualize what I've grown up reading and/or watching 
from my childhood. My primary influences, as you can see, are comics.
I discovered comics as a child, reading them at my father's office
in a supermarket in Bahrain. (Jawad Cold Stores!)

From top to bottom, the poster follows a lightly chronological flow, 
from left to right even. I plan to write a separate page on analysing this
but for now this should suffice.

The second idea is that this is my adaptation of the *Where's Wally* concept.
Find the Pink Panther!
